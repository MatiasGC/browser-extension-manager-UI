# Frontend Mentor - Browser extensions manager UI

This is my solution to a small personal project where I built a simple Extensions Manager UI.
It allows users to enable/disable extensions, remove them, filter the list, and keep all changes persistent using LocalStorage — all built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**

## Overview

Users can:

- View a list of browser-like extensions
- Enable or disable each extension
- Remove extensions with a smooth transition animation
- Filter extensions by: All, Enabled, Disabled
- Switch between Light and Dark mode, with theme persistence
- Enjoy a responsive layout
- Keep all extension data stored using LocalStorage (IDs, states, theme)

## Built with

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (custom properties, responsive design, transitions)
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
- LocalStorage:
  - Extension data persistence
  - Theme persistence
- **CSS Flexbox** & **Grid**
- HTML <template> cloning for dynamic rendering

## What I learned

This project helped me practice working with:

- DOM manipulation and dynamic card rendering
- Working with <template> and cloning nodes
- Creating a clean separation between UI state and pure JavaScript state
- LocalStorage for long-term data persistence
- Custom light/dark theme using CSS variables
- Animations with CSS transitions and startViewTransition()
- Implementing filters with class toggling
- Error handling with async data fetching
